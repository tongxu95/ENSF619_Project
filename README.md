# ENSF619Project
ENSF619 Movie Theater Ticket Reservation App

In this project your task is to analyze, design, and develop a system that can be used by two group of users: ordinary users that can search for a movie, view available show times, view graphically available seats, select the desired seat, make payment by creditcard, receive a copy of ticket and the receipt. Users also should be able to cancel their ticket only up to 72 hours prior to show and receive a credit with %15 administration fee for future purchase up maximum of one-year expiration date. The other group of users are those who must be registered (let’s call them Registered Users, RUs), and their information such as name, address, credit and/or debit card account must be saved on the system’s database. RUs must pay a $20.00 annual account fee, but they don't have to pay 15% admin fee for cancelling their tickets.
